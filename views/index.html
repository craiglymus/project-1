        ----- is an open-source database for bug lovers and curious minds to explore and identify the creepy crawlies that fascinate us.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Hive created the ----- database as a supplement to existing resources. Our mission is to create an easy to use tool that will help naturalists and scientists identify their specimens. As we grow, we hope to make this a 21st century tool that will allow our users to more readily access the insect taxonomy identification that was previously pinned in a collection of old textbooks and hard to read keys.
      </p>
      <p>
        All of the information in our database has been generously contributed by users like you.
      </p>
      <p>
        --- comes fitted with an intuitive API. Read our documentation <a href="/">here</a>.
